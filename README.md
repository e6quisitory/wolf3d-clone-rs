# Wolfenstein 3D Clone in Rust
I've previously [implemented](https://github.com/e6quisitory/wolf3d-clone) a Wolfenstein 3D renderer in C++. Now, I've decided it's time to hop on the Rust bandwagon. So, as a first project, to teach myself the language, I'm porting over the project to Rust.

### Completed
- [x] Raycasting
- [x] Texture mapping
- [x] Custom map loading from CSV
- [x] Controls (WASD & arrow keys)
- [x] Wall collision detection

### Remaining
- [ ] Doors
- [ ] Sprites (objects & enemies)
- [ ] Mouse to look around instead of arrow keys
- [ ] Minimap
